# ORF409 Python Primer

It is probably good to send the setup and the Python and NumPy basics
to the students in advance.  Then you should be able to walk through
the Python and NumPy basics quickly and move to the examples.

The ethos of the examples is: try to reuse existing NumPy and Python structures to build what you need rather than writing a lot of potentially buggy and verbose code.  An ounce of reading documentation is worth a pound of writing involved code.

Both "basics" files are really bare essentials of stuff I used to
solve the two problems Mete showed me.
