# ORF409 Python Primer

The ethos of the solutions presented to the examples is: try to reuse
existing NumPy and Python structures to build what you need rather
than writing a lot of potentially buggy and verbose code.  An ounce of
reading documentation is worth a pound of writing involved code.

The order in which to present the files is probably:

* intro_and_setup.ipynb
* python_basics.ipynb
* numpy_basics.ipynb
* two_examples.ipynb

It is probably good to send the setup and the Python and NumPy basics
to the students in advance.  Then you should be able to walk through
the Python and NumPy basics quickly and move to the examples.

Both "basics" files are really bare essentials of stuff I used to
solve the two problems Mete showed me.

I have cleared out the output in all the files.  They are meant to be
run by the students as they work through the notebook, generating
output as they go.  All the random-number generators are seeded
explicitly, so if people run the cells in order, they should always
get the same results.

* **NOTE 1:** notebooks cannot be run in Github.  Instead, user need
to clone this repository to their laptops and then launch the
notebooks using Jupyter.  For everything to work, users should have a
local installation of Anaconda (so that they have a recent version of
NumPy and access to Jupyter notebooks).  Instructions for installing
Anaconda and launching Jupyter in a browser can be found
[here](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/education/training/virtual-workshop-requirements#jupyter).

* **NOTE 2:** for some weird reason, Github isn't always displaying
the Jupyter notebooks "nicely".  If you'd like users to be able to
view the notebooks better online, just paste the URL for this repo
into [https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).
