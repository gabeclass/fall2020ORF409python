# ORF409 Python Primer

The ethos of the solutions presented to the examples is: try to reuse
existing NumPy and Python structures to build what you need rather
than writing a lot of potentially buggy and verbose code.  An ounce of
reading documentation is worth a pound of writing involved code.

The order in which to present the files is probably:

* intro_and_setup.ipynb
* python_basics.ipynb
* numpy_basics.ipynb
* two_examples.ipynb

It is probably good to send the setup and the Python and NumPy basics
to the students in advance.  Then you should be able to walk through
the Python and NumPy basics quickly and move to the examples.

Both "basics" files are really bare essentials of stuff I used to
solve the two problems Mete showed me.
