    "This problem asks us to draw random values uniformly from the interval $[0,1)$ until the running sum exceeds 1.  Call $N$ the number of values we had to generate until we reached a sum above 1. Repeat this experiment 100 total times and average all the values of $N$ to get an estimate of $E[N]$.\n",

    "How should we implement this in code?\n",
    "\n",
    "One strategy is to write a loop -- generate one random number at a time, keep a running sum, record how many values it takes to exceed 1, and then start the loop anew, looping over *that* inner loop 100 times (or 1K times or 10K times).\n",
    "\n",
    "This would work, but it would be a lot of code.  Instead, we can lighten our coding burden by leveraging some obvious (and a few less obvious) features of numpy...\n",
    "\n",
    "`np.random.random()` can be a given a single scalar argument (indicating the number of values to choose) or a tuple (indicating a shape if you want an array with more than 1 dimension).  Now, realistically, how many values do suspect we'd need to draw before we got a sum that exceeded 1? I'd say 1000 is probably fairly safe (and if it turns out not to be, we can come back and increase that value).\n",
    "\n",
    "So why don't we just generate a 2D array of random values:  10K rows (each row is one \"run\" of the experiment), and 1000 columns (i.e. 1000 random values drawn in each experiment). Then, along each row, we can perform a `cumsum()` (which gives a running total) and pick out in each row the index where the running total has exceeded 1 (given how `cumsum()` works, i.e. that the entry in the result with index $k$ is the result of adding the first $k+1$ numbers in the original array, we'll need to add 1 to our index results to get the right value of $N$ in each experiment).\n",
    "\n",
    "What we'll have by the end is an array of 10K $N$ values.  To estimate $E[N]$ using only 100 values, we can just slice, and average the first 100.  Ditto for the first 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that all of this can be done in very few lines of numpy, with no loops anywhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "Is it wasteful, in the sense that we're generating far more random values than we'll need?  Probably, but so what?  We're talking about 10 million floating point numbers.  That's maybe 100MB of RAM occupied and a few seconds of computation time.  And if it's really too much, we'll break up the problem and do 10 successive batches of 1000 runs.\n",

    "In the event that you need a much larger $N$ than we've discussed to get a handle on this probability via simulation, it's worth noting that there's a way to make each 59x5 grid of one-year lottery results occupy less memory.  Elements in a NumPy array must all be of the same data type, but the data type doesn't have to be a native Python data type.  NumPy understands C-level data types, which are more nuanced.  For instance, instead of just `int`s, NumPy can accommodate signed or unsigned integers and even allocate different amounts of space, i.e. a different number of available digits, to store that number.\n",

That might make the different between having enough memory on your laptop to hold the array or not, depending on how large we end up needing to make $N$.\n",
